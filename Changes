version 0.005; 2011-07-25

  * bugfix: work around core bug [perl #73174] affecting Unicode swash
    loading, and apply entire workaround arrangement to 5.11.{0..5}
    where [perl #73174] exists but [perl #68590] does not

  * correct dynamic_config setting to 0

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.004; 2010-11-21

  * bugfix: don't attempt to use XS version of the workaround on Win32,
    where it can't work properly due to linker restriction on access to
    core symbols

  * only define PERL_CORE for compilation on Perl versions where the
    bug workaround (and thus interference with core-private stuff)
    is actually necessary

  * in XS, use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT for efficiency

  * in XS, declare "PROTOTYPES: DISABLE" to prevent automatic generation
    of unintended prototypes

  * in XS, provide a reserve definition of croak, so that the Perl_croak
    circumlocution is avoided even with PERL_CORE defined

  * in XS, give symbolic names to the Perl version thresholds

  * jump through hoops to avoid compiler warnings

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * also test POD coverage of pure Perl implementation

  * in t/setup_pp.pl, avoid a warning that occurs if XSLoader::load()
    is given no arguments, which is now a valid usage

  * in Build.PL, explicitly set needs_compiler to avoid bogus
    auto-dependency on ExtUtils::CBuilder

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

version 0.003; 2010-04-10

  * bugfix: in pure-Perl implementation, make sure ambient package (from
    which require is invoked) is passed on correctly to the code in the
    required file, on those Perls where it is so inherited

  * in XS, use macros to avoid explicit passing of aTHX, in the manner
    of the core

  * in XS, avoid using "class" as a variable name, for compatibility
    with C++ compilers

  * make all numeric comparisons against $] stringify it first, to avoid
    architecture-dependent problems with floating point rounding giving
    it an unexpected numeric value

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * add MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.002; 2009-10-21

  * generate a more normal-looking op tree, that doesn't crash B::Deparse

  * don't apply the workaround on Perl 5.11.0 or later, where the bug
    has been fixed

  * in t/seal.t, test that cop_hints_hash is properly handled

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

version 0.001; 2009-09-26

  * bugfix: die cleanly if the pure-Perl implementation is needed but
    won't work (which occurs on pre-5.8 perls)

  * bugfix: avoid undesired warning from pure-Perl implementation if
    require has already been overridden via CORE::GLOBAL::require

  * in tests, set HINT_LOCALIZE_HH where appropriate, to avoid false
    test failures on pre-5.10 perls

  * test that the module plays nicely with code that overrides require
    via CORE::GLOBAL::require

version 0.000; 2009-09-22

  * initial released version
