version 0.002; 2009-10-21

  * generate a more normal-looking op tree, that doesn't crash B::Deparse

  * don't apply the workaround on Perl 5.11.0 or later, where the bug
    has been fixed

  * in t/seal.t, test that cop_hints_hash is properly handled

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

version 0.001; 2009-09-26

  * bugfix: die cleanly if the pure-Perl implementation is needed but
    won't work (which occurs on pre-5.8 perls)

  * bugfix: avoid undesired warning from pure-Perl implementation if
    require has already been overridden via CORE::GLOBAL::require

  * in tests, set HINT_LOCALIZE_HH where appropriate, to avoid false
    test failures on pre-5.10 perls

  * test that the module plays nicely with code that overrides require
    via CORE::GLOBAL::require

version 0.000; 2009-09-22

  * initial released version
